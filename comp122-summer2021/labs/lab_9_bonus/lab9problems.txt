Lab 9 Problems: K-Maps with Don't Cares, Multiplexers, and ALUs

---DON'T CARES IN KARNAUGH MAPS (K-MAPS)---

1.) (40 pts)Given this truth table, find the unoptimized formula this corresponds
to, along with the version which was optimized with a K-Map.

Unoptimized Sum of Products equation
1a) O =

Draw the K-map and simplify
Optimized Sum of Products equation
1b) O =



2) (60 pts)The first problem of step 1 of Lab 7 required you to write out the truth table 
for addition with a single bit.
The questions below build on top of that work.

What is the unoptimized sum-of-products formula corresponding to R?

2a) R =

Draw a K-map and simplify the formula above.
Optimized Sum of Products equation:

2b) R =


What is the unoptimized sum-of-products formula corresponding to Cout?

2c) Cout =

Draw a K-map and simplify the formula above.
Optimized Sum of Products equation:

2d) Cout =

2e) Draw the circuit corresponding to Cout and include it in your submission
as "lab9cout.jpg".  You do NOT need to draw the circuit for R as it is
prohibitively large.
