      From here, you need to upload the following two files:
    </p>

      <li><code>lab0questions.txt</code></li>
      <li><code>lab0_quiz_questions.txt</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Be sure that the filenames are correct, and that they are both plain text files.
    </p>

      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
